Analysis & Insights                          
Illness Distribution: The analysis shows how illnesses are distributed among genders and age groups. This helps identify patterns in how certain diseases affect different demographics.                          
Income & Healthcare: We found a correlation between income and frequency of doctor visits, with individuals in higher income brackets visiting doctors more regularly.                                 
Insurance Coverage: The project also examines the extent of health insurance coverage across various groups. This helps identify gaps in coverage and areas that require attention.                                   
Activity Reduction: A detailed analysis of how activity levels are reduced due to illness shows which illnesses are most likely to lead to reduced physical activity, influencing productivity and quality of life.                                                           
Health Status vs. Activity: The project compares health status and activity reduction, offering insights into how different levels of health (good, poor, etc.) affect daily activities.                                            

### Visualizations
The analysis includes various visualizations such as:

Heatmap: Shows correlations between different variables like age, illness type, income, etc.

Bar Plots: Used for comparing illness frequency across genders and income groups.

Line Graphs: Visualize trends in health status and activity levels over time.
